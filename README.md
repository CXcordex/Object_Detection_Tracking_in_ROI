# Object_Detection_Tracking_in_ROI
This project implements a real-time object detection system to monitor and count people in predefined Regions of Interest (ROIs) within a video feed using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model. The system is optimized for efficiency and can be deployed on live video feeds (e.g., from CCTV cameras) or prerecorded video files.
